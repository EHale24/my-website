    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p><strong> Hello! My name is Evelyn Hale, and I live in beautiful Orlando, Florida. I’m a proud mom of two amazing kids and the happy owner of two energetic German Shepherds who keep our family on our toes! Life in our home is full of love, laughter, and a little bit of chaos — just the way I like it.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>I'm married to my best friend and biggest supporter, and together we're raising our family with a strong foundation of curiosity, kindness, and ambition. Whether it’s visiting theme parks on the weekend or family movie nights, I always cherish the time I get to spend with my loved ones.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Professionally, I’m on an exciting journey to become a Cloud Engineer. I’ve recently immersed myself in learning about cloud platforms, building websites, and understanding the infrastructure that powers the digital world. I'm passionate about technology and always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and create solutions that make a difference.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Thank you so much for visiting my website — I cannot wait to see where this tech journey takes me to! The sky is NOT the limit! Follow my journey on LinkedIn and GitHub using the links below.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>With Love,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Evelyn</strong></p>
